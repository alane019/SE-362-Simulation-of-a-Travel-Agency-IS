When you arrive the city where you travel, you can adjust a rental car. It is an option for reaching the destination. Moreover, you can handle the which hotel you are going to stay. It is going the relevant where you stay. When we look at the technical side, there should be admin and customer logins. For example, if the flights are changing, admin should update that, and customer should see the changes.
